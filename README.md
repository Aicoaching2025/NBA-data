## **📈 Visualizations**
### **1️⃣ Distribution of Points Per Game (Histogram)**
This histogram shows how often each team scored within certain point ranges.

📌 **What This Reveals:**  
- The **Knicks had more consistent scoring**.  
- The **Nets had greater variations in their points per game**.  

```python
sns.histplot(knicks_pts_10, bins=10, kde=True, color="blue", label="Knicks 2010", alpha=0.6)
sns.histplot(nets_pts_10, bins=10, kde=True, color="lightgreen", label="Nets 2010", alpha=0.6)
```

### **2️⃣ Boxplot: Spread of Points Per Game**
A boxplot displays **the distribution, median, and outliers** for each team’s points per game.

📌 **What This Reveals:**  
- The **Knicks had a tighter scoring range**, meaning they were **more consistent**.  
- The **Nets had more outliers**, indicating **high variation in performance**.  

```python
sns.boxplot(data=[knicks_pts_10, nets_pts_10, knicks_pts_14, nets_pts_14], 
            palette=["blue", "lightgreen", "darkblue", "seagreen"])
```

### **3️⃣ Side-by-Side Bar Chart: Comparing 2010 & 2014**
This bar chart compares **the average points per game** for the Knicks & Nets over the two seasons.

📌 **What This Reveals:**  
- **Nets improved slightly from 2010 to 2014**.  
- **Knicks remained relatively stable** in their scoring.  

```python
plt.bar(x - bar_width/2, knicks_averages, width=bar_width, color='blue', label='Knicks')
plt.bar(x + bar_width/2, nets_averages, width=bar_width, color='lightgreen', label='Nets')
```
